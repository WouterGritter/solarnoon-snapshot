# solarnoon-snapshot
A tool to create a snapshot of an http(s)-enabled camera at solar noon.

I created this tool because I have a security camera pointed at a newly placed tree, and I wanted to make a timelapse of
this tree growing. With this tool I can make a CRON-job which will run once every day, which will take a screenshot of the
camera at solar noon to make a nice timelapse.
